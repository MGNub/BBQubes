                <h2>Origins of Speedcubing (1982)</h2>
                <p>The Rubik's Cube was invented in 1974 by Hungarian professor of architecture Ernő Rubik (born July 13, 1944). In 1979, Ernő Rubik partnered with Ideal Toy Company to garner widespread international interest in the cube, which soon developed into a global trend. On June 5, 1982, the first world championship was held in Budapest, Hungary. Nineteen people competed in the event, and the American Minh Thai won with a single solve time of 22.95 seconds, which was, at the time, the fastest Rubik's Cube solve ever recorded in the competition. The Rubik's Cube waned in popularity after 1983, but with the advent of the Internet, sites began to surface to discuss the cube. With these websites facilitating the renewed popularity of the cube, it ushered in a new generation of cubers, creating a growing international community of people dedicated to the sport of speedsolving.</p>

                <h2>DownFall of Speedcubing (2006, December 12)</h2>
                <p>On this very day, a baby by the name of Chris Zheng was born. A baby with a will like no other. With time, he quickly took the entire speedcubing world by storm, and dominated every world championship on path to glory. He is known for making former world record holder of a 3x3, Max Park shed tears after utterly destroying him, with a PB of -0.93 seconds. Afterwards, speedcubing competitions started to become less and less frequent until it completely died out. Chris Zheng is a name that will terrorize any veteran cuber that has seen his deathly solves in action. His big success can not be left without the big support of his greatest sister, Tiphphonie. </p>
